About:
=============

I started this program as a small project to learning  the C# language and learn APIs.
so my programming method may be primitive and not sufficiently developed, 
but my goal is mainly to help users "like me" who need link shortening services, 
and donot find a tool on the computer to shorten links, so I started learning and 

I search for each service and try to create a software code for it to facilitate shortening links in one tool only, and my idea began to appear at first as separate tools.

but it became clear to me that it would be confusing to develop in more than one project, so I combined them in.

My Goals:
=============

1. That there be a software interface for all link shortening services, it started by sending the long link, and the user returns the short link in his service

2. That the interface be open, anyone can open the kout and develop it and help me in developing it if possible

4. The program is not intended to be sold, but to verify accuracy, I use my service keys for those who cannot and do not have accounts to shorten links

5. Every free service remains free, every service that has ads will still have ads, and if I use my service keys, I have the right to profit from the links used as compensation for my efforts in making the program

6. You can use your private keys, save them, and deal with them in your accounts without any damage or tracking, or even send the keys to any party.
